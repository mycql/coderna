## Who I Am

Engineer by heart and passionate about all things software.
Looking good on paper is not my thing. I design. I engineer. I get things done.
Implementing cloud solutions for modern bioinformatics workflows keep me busy during the day and hackernews articles with coffee wraps up my evenings.

I live to learn. [#juniordevforlife](https://twitter.com/hashtag/juniordevforlife)

## What I Do Now

In terms of work, my teams’ philosophy in our choice of technology is to use the right tools for the job leveraging on our engineers' skillset:
- Java based microservices on Marathon/Mesos or AWS ECS clusters
- Containerized (docker) Java/Python/C based analysis pipelines
- Bioinformatics algorithms on serverless (AWS Lambda) infrastructure
- Canvas and SVG viewers in TypeScript
- Selenium, Puppeteer, Cypress for testing, SonarQube for code quality analysis
- Jenkins Pipelines for CI/CD
- Datadog, Splunk, Hotjar for monitoring

We’re not afraid of technology; We embrace it. We build it.
